# Production image. Build with `--target prod`; the earlier stages exist only to
# feed it and never ship.
#
# The build runs on Debian and the runtime on Alpine, which is the one thing here
# worth understanding before changing anything:
#
#   - The BUILD runs on Debian, i.e. glibc. rolldown (which vite 8 uses in place of
#     rollup), @tailwindcss/oxide and lightningcss are all native, and npm selects
#     each one's platform binary from that package's own os/cpu-gated
#     optionalDependencies. .npmrc sets ignore-scripts=true, which is fine because
#     none of them need a postinstall step to do it. package.json used to pin the
#     glibc binaries by hand; those pins went away with the move to vite 8, which
#     left the rollup ones pointing at a package no longer in the tree at all.
#
#   - The RUNTIME does not. Nothing compiled crosses the boundary: PHP extensions are
#     installed per-stage, node never enters `prod`, and composer's output is pure PHP.
#     Alpine's FrankenPHP is 302MB against bookworm's 872MB, so staying on Debian for
#     the runtime would cost about 570MB on every pull for nothing.
#
#   - The invariant that keeps this honest: everything copied out of a build stage must
#     be libc-agnostic. That holds for vendor/ and public/build today. A composer
#     package shipping a compiled component would break it, and the symptom would be a
#     runtime "cannot open shared object file", not a build failure.
#
# The other non-obvious constraint is that the asset build needs PHP, not just node:
# @laravel/vite-plugin-wayfinder shells out to `php artisan wayfinder:generate` from
# its buildStart() hook, and resources/js/{actions,routes,wayfinder} are gitignored -
# they exist only after that command runs. Hence node grafted onto a PHP base rather
# than the reverse.
#
# Finally, the build needs outbound network to fonts.bunny.net: vite.config.ts passes
# `fonts: [bunny('Instrument Sans')]` to laravel-vite-plugin, which downloads the faces
# at build time and self-hosts them under public/build/assets. An offline `docker build`
# fails there, with a fetch error rather than anything self-explanatory.
